# peliculasApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.11.

## Development server

Run `ionic serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8100/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ionic g component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Installs Ionic Storage

Run `npm install @ionic/storage-angular` this command installs Ionic Storage, a simple and flexible key-value storage system for Angular and Ionic applications. 
It provides a unified API that works across browsers and mobile devices, using the best available storage engine (IndexedDB, LocalStorage, SQLite via plugins, etc.).

## Installs Swiper

Run `npm install swiper@latest` It was required because Ionic v6 no longer includes <ion-slides>, which was removed in favor of the standalone Swiper library. 
To continue using slide components, carousels, or horizontal swipeable galleries, you must install Swiper manually and integrate it directly into your Angular/Ionic project.

## Adds Progressive Web App (PWA)

Support to your Angular project. It configures everything needed for installable, offline-capable apps, including:

-A service worker for caching and offline behavior
-A manifest.json for app metadata (icon, name, theme, etc.)
-Default app icons and assets
-Automatic Angular build configuration for PWA features

It was needed to enable the app to behave like a native installable application, work offline, and improve performance through caching.
